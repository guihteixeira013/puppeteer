## What's pupppeteer?
Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default, but can be configured to run in full ("headful") Chrome/Chromium.

## What can i do?
Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

<ul>
    <li>Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.</li>
    <li>Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).</li>
    <li>Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.</li>
    <li>Create an automated testing environment using the latest JavaScript and browser features.</li>
    <li>Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.</li>
    <li>Test Chrome Extensions.</li>
</ul>
